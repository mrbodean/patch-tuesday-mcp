"""EPSS and CISA KEV enrichment clients with in-process caching.

Both sources are fully public and keyless:
- EPSS (FIRST.org): daily exploitation probability per CVE
  https://www.first.org/epss/api
- CISA KEV: the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog
  https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog

Enrichment is best-effort: fetch failures are logged and swallowed so the
tool layer always gets a dict back (possibly empty), never an exception.
