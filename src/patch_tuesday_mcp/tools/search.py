    """Search Microsoft security updates (Patch Tuesday) from the official MSRC API.

    Combines keyword search, CVE/KB lookup, and product/severity/exploitation
    filtering into a single flexible tool. All filter parameters are optional
    and can be combined. When no filters are provided, returns the most urgent
    vulnerabilities from the most recent *released* Patch Tuesday (CISA-KEV-
    listed or exploited first, then by EPSS exploitation probability, severity,
    and CVSS score). The upcoming month's document exists before its Patch
    Tuesday but only holds early Chromium/third-party and out-of-band entries;
    it is skipped by default and served only when requested via month=.
    Results are enriched with EPSS scores (FIRST.org daily exploit
    prediction, 0-1) and CISA KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities) catalog
    data when available.

    Use this tool to:
    - Get the latest Patch Tuesday overview (include_stats=True, limit=0)
    - Browse the most urgent fixes this month (no filters)
    - Look up a specific CVE with full detail (cve="CVE-2026-41108") -- works
      across all months, returns KBs, affected products, CVSS, description,
      FAQs, EPSS score, and KEV status
    - Find which CVEs a KB article fixes (kb="5094123" or kb="KB5094123") --
      scans recent months, or a specific month when combined with month=
    - Check whether a KB has been superseded by newer patches (kb="5087538",
      include_chain=True) -- walks Microsoft-stated supersedence links
    - Find KEV-listed CVEs this month (kev=True) -- confirmed exploited, with
      federal remediation due dates
    - High exploitation probability (min_epss=0.5) -- EPSS >= 50%
    - Search by keyword (query="Exchange" or query="DNS spoofing")
    - Filter to a product (product="Windows Server 2022") -- partial match
    - Filter by severity (severity="Critical") -- Critical/Important/Moderate/Low
    - Find actively exploited vulnerabilities (exploited=True)
    - Find publicly disclosed zero-days (publicly_disclosed=True)
    - Filter by CVSS score (min_cvss=8.0)
    - Look at a past month (month="2026-Apr" or month="2026-04")
    - Combine filters (product="Exchange" + severity="Critical" + month="2026-05")
    - Paginate with offset (offset=10, limit=10 for page 2)

    Args:
        query: Optional keyword; case-insensitive match across CVE ID, title,
            description, component tag, and affected product names.
        cve: Optional CVE ID (e.g. "CVE-2026-41108"). Fast path: ignores other
            filters and returns full detail for that single CVE, searching
            across all months automatically.
        kb: Optional KB article number (e.g. "5094123" or "KB5094123"). Fast
            path: returns the CVEs fixed by that KB, scanning the most recent
            months (up to 6), or only the given month when month= is also set.
            Honors limit/offset; other filters are ignored.
        month: Optional monthly release to search, formatted "2026-Apr" or
            "2026-04". Defaults to the most recent release whose Patch
            Tuesday (second Tuesday of the month) has already occurred; pass
            the upcoming month explicitly to see its pre-release entries.
            Combined with kb=, restricts the KB lookup to that month.
        product: Optional product name filter (case-insensitive partial match
            against affected product names, e.g. "Windows Server 2022").
        severity: Optional maximum-severity filter. Valid values: Critical,
            Important, Moderate, Low.
        exploited: Optional filter for vulnerabilities known to be exploited
            in the wild (True) or not (False), per Microsoft's assessment.
        publicly_disclosed: Optional filter for publicly disclosed
            vulnerabilities.
        kev: Optional filter for CVEs on (True) or off (False) the CISA Known
            Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.
        min_epss: Optional minimum EPSS score (0-1), the probability of
            exploitation in the next 30 days (e.g. 0.5 for >= 50%).
        min_cvss: Optional minimum CVSS base score (0-10).
        attack_vector: Optional CVSS attack-vector filter, one of N (network),
            A (adjacent), L (local), P (physical). Matches the parsed CVSS v3.x
            vector; entries without a parseable vector are excluded.
        privileges_required: Optional CVSS privileges-required filter, one of
            N (none), L (low), H (high).
        user_interaction: Optional CVSS user-interaction filter, one of
            N (none), R (required).
        scope: Optional CVSS scope filter, one of U (unchanged), C (changed).
        include_chain: When True together with kb=, adds a supersedence_chain
            showing which KBs this KB replaces (newest to oldest), walked from
            Microsoft-stated supersedence links. Ignored without kb=.
        include_guidance: When True together with cve=, adds a guidance list to
            the CVE detail output with any Microsoft-provided mitigations,
            workarounds, and will-not-fix advisories (type/description/url).
            Omitted by default to keep responses lean. Ignored without cve=.
        limit: Maximum number of results to return (default: 10, max: 100).
            Set to 0 with include_stats=True for a stats-only month overview.
        offset: Number of results to skip for pagination (default: 0).
        include_stats: When True, includes aggregate counts (by severity,
            impact, product family, exploited, KEV, publicly disclosed) for
            the filtered result set.

    Returns:
        Dictionary with:
        - month: Release ID (e.g. "2026-Jun") and title/release date
        - total_found: Number of vulnerabilities matching the filters
        - vulnerabilities: List of compact vulnerability summaries (up to
          limit) with epss_score and kev flag when available; full detail
          (epss_percentile, KEV due dates) returned for cve= lookups
        - filters_applied: Summary of which filters were used
        - stats: (only when include_stats=True) aggregate counts
        - supersedence_chain / chain_complete: (only for kb= lookups with
          include_chain=True) the walked chain, newest to oldest
        - guidance: (only for cve= lookups with include_guidance=True) list of
          mitigation/workaround/will-not-fix advisories, when Microsoft
          provides them
        - error / error_kind: (only on failure) a message plus a category
          (invalid_input, not_found, upstream)
        - note: (when relevant) explains month selection, e.g. that a newer
          pre-Patch-Tuesday document was skipped, or (with
          release_status="pre-patch-tuesday") that the requested month has
          not had its Patch Tuesday yet
